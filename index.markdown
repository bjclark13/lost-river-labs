        <div>
            <p>
                We are a family breeder located in central Indiana. Our home is situated on eight rolling acres
                with
                an acre pond. Needless to say, it’s hard to keep our dogs dry!
            </p>
            <p>
                We fell in love with our first Lab in
                1998 and began raising Chocolate AKC English Labradors in 2007. We strive to produce top
                quality,
                healthy, happy, well-socialized dogs.
            </p>
            <p>Labs are excellent family dogs with great personalities.
                Always eager to please, whether in the field, show ring or living room, a Lab will steal your
                heart!
                We here at Lost River Ridge Labradors would love the opportunity to help you find the perfect
                addition to your family.

                Our puppies are de-wormed, have a vet wellness check, including their first vaccination and are
                micro-chipped before leaving for their forever homes at 8 weeks old. We require each puppy to be
                registered with American Kennel Club (AKC) and their microchip registered with AKC Reunite. This
                cost is
                included in the price of your puppy.
            </p>
