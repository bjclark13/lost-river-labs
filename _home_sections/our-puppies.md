                Our puppies are de-wormed, have a vet wellness check, including their first vaccination and are
                micro-chipped before leaving for their forever homes at 8 weeks old. We require each puppy to be
                registered with American Kennel Club (AKC) and their microchip registered with AKC Reunite. This
                cost is
                included in the price of your puppy.
