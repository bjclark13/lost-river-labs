    <p>Our puppies are de-wormed, have a vet wellness check, including their first vaccination and are micro-chipped before leaving for their forever homes at 8 weeks old. We require each puppy to be registered with American Kennel Club (AKC) and their microchip registered with AKC Reunite. This cost is included in the price of your puppy.</p>
